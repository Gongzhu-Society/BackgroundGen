# BackgroundGen
This repository intends to create background of our main page automatically. After a given interval of time the background will be updated, which allows users to see different pictures at different logins.
There are codes for generating pictures with different styles, and the instances are also attached. It's up to Chief Designer's discretion to put the best codes into use.
